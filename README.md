# Mistral-7B-Healthcare

This is an implementation of pretrained Mistral-7B model for Healthcare domain. It is deployed using Gradio on HuggingFace Spaces. The main purpose of this model is to provide a quick way to show the capabilities of Mistral-7B model on Healthcare/Wellness/Medical domain, and to provide a quick way to test the model on providing context for Healthcare and Wellness. It can be used to generate outputs using outputs from other models typicaly used in these domains(as Human Activity Recognition-HAR models) as inputs to the Mistral-7B model LLM.

## How to use

The deployed model can be accessed at [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shekswess/Mistral-7B-Healthcare](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shekswess/Mistral-7B-Healthcare).

1. Enter the structured text in the input box.
2. Click on the `Submit` button.
3. The output will be generated in the output box.

## How to deploy your own model on HuggingFace Spaces

1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to [https://huggingface.co/spaces/new](https://huggingface.co/spaces/new).
3. Create a new space(you can name it anything you want).
4. Create secret tokens for your space on HuggingFace Spaces.
5. Create secret tokens on the forked repository on GitHub.
6. Change the deploy workflow file to use your secret tokens and space name.
7. Commit the changes and push to the forked repository to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.
